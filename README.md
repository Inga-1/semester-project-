# semester-project-

The purpose of the project is creating an editor, similar to paint, 
which will include the key operations, such as drawing and deleting 
lines, different shapes (circles, rectangles), as well as choosing 
specific colors both for the outlines and for filling in the shapes. 
Additionally, one can choose a certain background based on their 
creative needs. It is possible to upload an existing file and continue 
editing it, or save the current drawing to a file.
